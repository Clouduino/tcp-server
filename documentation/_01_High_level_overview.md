# Introduction

The purpose of this library is to provide a server that arbitrary devices can connect to
using a very simple protocol. The protocol is very simple and lightweight and designed
with Arduino like devices in mind.

It's implemented using Akka to allow the user of this library to use it in a scalable
environment.

The complete `0xF0` to `0xFF` range is reserved.
